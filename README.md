Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

First Time Visitor Goals

As a First Time Visitor, I want to understand the purpose of the site and learn more about Grassroots GAA.

Upon entering the site, users will be met with a nav bar and logo for the site, the hero image will draw their attention and below is a short about us section and a video related to the GAA.

There is a section on the benefits of playing team sports.

They will then be able to click into the tab for instructional videos on the fundamentals of Gaelic Football. 

Finally the user can find gaa clubs that are local to them with our club locator feature, it allows candidates to refine by province, then county and will redirect to the club hub of the relevant county website.

I have included a contact us form to allow users to get in touch.

The site has been designed to be user friendly and the nav bar will easily direct users throughout the site.

As a Returning Visitor, I want to find new content available regularly and know how to get in touch with the site.

The Facebook Page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.

As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new instructional videos or improved features.
