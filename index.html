    <p>
        The Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) is Ireland’s largest sporting organisation. It is celebrated as one of the great amateur sporting associations in the world.
        <br>
        It is part of the Irish consciousness and plays an influential role in Irish society that extends far beyond the basic aim of promoting Gaelic games.
        <br>
        It was founded in November 1884 at a meeting in Thurles, Co. Tipperary, by a group of spirited Irishmen who had the foresight to realise the importance of establishing a national organisation to make athletics more accessible to the masses and to revive and nurture traditional,indigenous sports and pastimes.

            <h2>Regular Exercise</h2>
            <hr>
            Training with a team makes it easy to achieve the recommended 150 minutes of physical activity a week! 
            Regular exercise is also a great habit to form while you’re young and it’ll help you stay healthy for the rest of your life.

        <h2>Teamwork</h2>
        <hr>
            Playing in a team requires coordination, communication and collaboration. 
            These are important life skills that will help you work well with others and achieve success in and out of the playing arena. 
            The office and the classroom are arenas where teamwork makes the dream work!

            <h2>Communication Skills</h2>
            <hr>
            Team sports require a lot of verbal and non-verbal communication. 
            From words of encouragement during training to planning for a match, communication is a two way street, and learning skills to deliver the message and listening are critical skills forged in the fun of playing.

            <h2>Critical Thinking</h2>
            <hr>
            Every match is different, and every opponent has their own strengths and weaknesses. Formulating tactics to tackle the various challenges you encounter will hone your critical thinking skills and make you a better problem solver. Problem Solving is a great skill to develop in children and doing it in a fun and active way through team sports is ideal.

            <h2>Stress Management</h2>
            <hr>
            Tightly knit relationships are formed beyond the team too. For example, schoolmates rallying together to support their teams fosters a more united school spirit and a sense of belonging.

            <h2>Community</h2>
            <hr>
            Exercise releases happy hormones such as dopamines and endorphins, which help us relax, reduce stress and improve our moods. So if you ever feel overwhelmed by school or work, take a mental break and enjoy your training sessions with your teammates!
