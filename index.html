                <li><h3>Regular Excercise:</h3>
                    <p>Training with a team makes it easy to achieve the recommended 150 minutes of physical activity a week! 
                       Regular exercise is also a great habit to form while you’re young. 
                       It’ll help you stay healthy for the rest of your life.</p>

                <li><h3>Teamwork:</h3>
                    <p>Playing in a team requires coordination, communication and collaboration. 
                       These are important life skills that will help you work well with others and achieve success in and out of the playing arena. 
                       The office and the classroom are arenas where teamwork makes the dream work!</p>

                <li><h3>Communication Skills:</h3>
                    <p>Team sports require a lot of verbal and non-verbal communication. 
                       From words of encouragement during training to planning for a match, communication is a two way street, 
                       and learning skills to deliver the message and listening are critical skills forged in the fun of playing.</p>

                <li><h3>Critical Thinking:</h3>
                    <p>Formulating tactics to tackle the various challenges you encounter will hone your critical thinking skills and make you a better problem solver. 
                       Problem Solving is a great skill to develop in children and doing it in a fun and active way through team sports is ideal.</p>

                <li><h3>Friendship:</h3>
                    <p>Joining a team is a great way to meet new people. 
                       As you train, overcome challenges, and win or lose together, you will forge strong bonds with your teammates that could last for years to come! 
                       Friendships will become social networks you can depend on, from the schoolyard to the board room.</p>

                <li><h3>Stress Management:</h3>
                    <p>Exercise releases happy hormones such as dopamines and endorphins, which help us relax, 
                       reduce stress and improve our moods. 
                       So if you ever feel overwhelmed by school or work, take a mental break 
                       and enjoy your training sessions with your teammates!</p>

                    <p> In team sports, every person plays a part in the overall success of the team. 
                        This is a great way to see how you can make a difference, and in turn, 
                        build up your self-confidence.</p>

                    <p>With every training session, we see our strength, stamina and gameplay improve.
