            <ul>
                <li>Gaelic Football is celebrated as one of the great amateur sports in the world. 
                <li>It's origins date back as far as the 1600s</li>
                <li>The GAA was founded on November 1st 1884 at a meeting in Thurles, Co. Tipperary, by a group of spirited Irishmen who had the foresight to realise the importance of establishing a national organisation to make athletics more accessible to the masses and to revive and nurture traditional, indigenous sports and pastimes.</li>
                <li>Until then all that was Irish was being steadily eroded by emigration, intense poverty and outside influences. 
                <li>Within six months of that famous first meeting, GAA clubs began to spring up all over Ireland and people began to play the games of Hurling and Gaelic Football and take part in Athletic events with pride.</li>   
                <li>It is part of the Irish consciousness and plays an influential role in Irish society that extends far beyond the basic aim of promoting Gaelic games.</li>

            <ol>
            <div class="benefits-left">
                <li><h3>Regular Excercise:</h3>
                    <p>Training with a team makes it easy to achieve the recommended 150 minutes of physical activity a week! 
                       Regular exercise is also a great habit to form while you’re young. 
                       It’ll help you stay healthy for the rest of your life.</p>
                </li>
            </div>
            <div class="benefits-center">
                <li><h3>Teamwork:</h3>
                    <p>Playing in a team requires coordination, communication and collaboration. 
                       These are important life skills that will help you work well with others and achieve success in and out of the playing arena. 
                       The office and the classroom are arenas where teamwork makes the dream work!</p>
                </li>
            </div>
            <div class="benefits-right">        
                <li><h3>Communication Skills:</h3>
                    <p>Team sports require a lot of verbal and non-verbal communication. 
                       From words of encouragement during training to planning for a match, communication is a two way street, 
                       and learning skills to deliver the message and listening are critical skills forged in the fun of playing.</p>
                </li>
            </div>
            <div class="benefits-left">    
                <li><h3>Critical Thinking:</h3>
                    <p>Every match is different, and every opponent has their own strengths and weaknesses. 
                       Formulating tactics to tackle the various challenges you encounter will hone your critical thinking skills and make you a better problem solver. 
                       Problem Solving is a great skill to develop in children and doing it in a fun and active way through team sports is ideal.</p>

            <div class="benefits-center">    
                <li><h3>Friendship:</h3>
                    <p>Joining a team is a great way to meet new people. 
                       As you train, overcome challenges, and win or lose together, you will forge strong bonds with your teammates that could last for years to come! 
                       Friendships will become social networks you can depend on, from the schoolyard to the board room.</p>
                </li>
            </div>
            <div class="benefits-right">    
                <li><h3>Stress Management:</h3>
                    <p>Exercise releases happy hormones such as dopamines and endorphins, which help us relax, 
                       reduce stress and improve our moods. 
                       So if you ever feel overwhelmed by school or work, take a mental break 
                       and enjoy your training sessions with your teammates!</p>

            <div class="benefits-left">    
                <li><h3>Self-Esteem & Self Confidence:</h3>
                    <p> In team sports, every person plays a part in the overall success of the team. 
                        This is a great way to see how you can make a difference, and in turn, 
                        build up your self-confidence.</p>
                </li>

            <div class="benefits-center">    
                <li><h3>Discipline & Perserverence:</h3>
                    <p>With every training session, we see our strength, stamina and gameplay improve. 
                       This motivates us to keep putting in effort if we want to see progress and results!</p>
